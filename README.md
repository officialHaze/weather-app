This is a Minimalist Weather App.

## About the web application

It's simple to use, with an intuitive and responsive interface that allows you to quickly see the current temperature and get an idea of what the forecast will be like. The app also provides additional information such as humidity, wind speed and visibility, so you can make the most informed decisions about how to dress or plan your day. With a simple UI you get all the necessary information including a graph giving you a visual representation of the average temperature per day for 4 consecutive days.

The app also changes its background and styling depending on the area's localtime. Currently the time period has been divided into 4 parts:-

1. Morning
2. Noon
3. Night/Evening
4. Midnight

It has been developed using Next.js, TypeScript, and OpenWeatherAPI(Free plan).
